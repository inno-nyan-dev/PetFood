# PetFood

Petfood is a mobile app, that helps its users to properly feed their pets. For now planned functionality is to allow users easily determine which food is safe to a pet, and in which quantities.

Despite the name, currently we are not focusing on all sorts and breeds of animals. We are focusing on rabbits only. And also we are planning only Android app, because we have competencies only in that.
